## My process

I started with HTML and CSS, and then I moved onto making the links popup on mobile phones first with JS. After that I finished the CSS for desktop devices and made the links popup interactively.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned quite a bit actually, mostly JS. I learned how to check for the size of the viewport and make something happen with JS based on that. Also with CSS I learned how to make a triangle as a pseudo element.

### Continued development

I gotta keep on learning JS at this stage and refine my HTML and CSS skills too.
